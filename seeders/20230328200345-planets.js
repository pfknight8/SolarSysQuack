This atmosphere plays a crucial role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun and regulating the planet's temperature.",

It is also the closest planet to the Sun and has the shortest orbital period of all the planets, completing one orbit in just 88 Earth days.",
        factTwo:
          "Mercury has a heavily cratered surface: Because it has no atmosphere to protect it from impacts, Mercury's surface is covered with impact craters. Some of these craters are hundreds of kilometers wide and date back to the early history of the solar system. Mercury's surface is also marked by long, steep cliffs (called scarps) that were likely formed by the planet's cooling and contracting interior.",

          "Mercury has a weak magnetic field: Despite its small size, Mercury has a magnetic field, which is about 1% as strong as Earth's. The origin of Mercury's magnetic field is still not well understood, but it is thought to be generated by the planet's partially molten iron core. The magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows from the Sun and can strip away a planet's atmosphere over time.",

The reason for Venus's extreme heat is its thick atmosphere, which traps heat from the Sun and creates a greenhouse effect.",
        factTwo:
          'Venus has a very slow rotation: Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. This means that a day on Venus is actually longer than a year on Venus, which takes about 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. Additionally, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in our solar system, which means that the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus.',
        factThree:
          "Venus has no moons or rings: Unlike most of the other planets in our solar system, Venus does not have any moons or rings. This is thought to be because Venus's strong gravitational pull would make it difficult for any nearby objects to maintain a stable orbit around the planet. Additionally, Venus's thick atmosphere would make it difficult for any small moons or rings to form and survive.",

Despite its size, Olympus Mons is thought to be extinct, with no evidence of recent volcanic activity.',
        factTwo:
          "Mars has a very thin atmosphere: The Martian atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's atmosphere, and it is mostly composed of carbon dioxide. The thin atmosphere means that Mars has a very weak greenhouse effect, which results in a cold and dry climate. However, the Martian atmosphere is thick enough to cause dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks or even months.",

          'Mars has evidence of past liquid water on its surface: While Mars is currently a cold and dry planet, there is evidence that liquid water existed on its surface in the past. Images taken by spacecraft have revealed features on the Martian surface, such as dry riverbeds and minerals that can only form in the presence of liquid water. Scientists believe that Mars may have had a warm and wet climate in its early history, but it eventually lost most of its atmosphere and surface water.',

This magnetic field creates intense radiation belts around Jupiter, which can be hazardous for spacecraft and can cause auroras to occur on the planet.",
